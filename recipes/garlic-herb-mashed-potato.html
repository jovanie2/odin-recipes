    <h2>Creamy, buttery mashed potatoes infused with roasted garlic and fresh herbs—comfort food perfected.</h2>
    <p>This side dish blends simple ingredients into something luxurious. Boiled potatoes are mashed with velvety butter and warm milk, then elevated with roasted garlic and a sprinkle of freshly chopped herbs like thyme and parsley. The result is smooth, savory, and irresistibly aromatic—an ideal companion to bold mains or a star on its own.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 kg (2.2 lbs) potatoes, peeled and chopped</li>
        <li>1 whole garlic bulb</li>
        <li>¼ cup butter</li>

        <li>1 tablespoon fresh thyme, chopped</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon fresh parsley, chopped</li>
        <li>Salt and black pepper, to taste</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
