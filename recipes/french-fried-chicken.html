    <h1>French Fried Chicken</h1>

    <h2>Golden, herb-crusted French-style fried chicken—crisp on the outside, succulent within.</h2>
    <p>French fried chicken brings sophistication to southern comfort. The chicken is marinated in a blend of buttermilk, Dijon mustard, garlic, and fresh herbs like thyme and rosemary. This soak not only tenderizes the meat but infuses it with layered flavor. After marinating, the chicken pieces are dredged in a seasoned flour mixture—sometimes with a touch of paprika or herbs de Provence—and double-coated for extra crunch.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 kg (2.2 lbs) chicken pieces (thighs, drumsticks, or breasts)</li>
        <li>2 cups buttermilk</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon fresh thyme, chopped</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon fresh rosemary, chopped</li>
        <li>Salt and black pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon paprika</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried herbs de Provence (optional)</li>
        <li>Neutral oil for deep frying (e.g., peanut or sunflower)</li>
        <li>Lime wedges – for garnish</li>
        <li>Fresh parsley or chives – for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
         <li>In a large bowl, whisk together buttermilk, Dijon mustard, garlic, thyme, rosemary, salt, and pepper.</li>
        <li>Add chicken pieces to the marinade, ensuring they’re fully coated. Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, ideally overnight.</li>
        <li>In another bowl, mix flour, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, herbs de Provence, salt, and pepper.</li>
        <li>Remove chicken from the marinade, letting excess drip off. Dredge each piece in the flour mixture, pressing to coat thoroughly.</li>
        <li>For extra crunch, dip coated chicken back into the marinade briefly, then re-dredge in the flour mixture a second time.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a deep pan to 175°C (350°F). Fry chicken in batches without overcrowding, turning occasionally until golden brown and crispy—about 12 to 15 minutes per batch.</li>
        <li>Transfer cooked chicken to a rack or paper towel-lined plate. Let rest for a few minutes to keep it crispy.</li>
        <li>Garnish with lime wedges and fresh herbs. Serve hot with coleslaw and a cold soda or your favorite sides.</li>
    </ol>
